	Abstract = {Most QTL mapping approaches seek to identify "mean QTL", genetic loci that influence the phenotype mean, after assuming that all individuals in the mapping population have equal residual variance. Recent work has broadened the scope of QTL mapping to identify genetic loci that influence phenotype variance, termed "variance QTL", or some combination of mean and variance, which we term "mean-variance QTL". Even these approaches, however, fail to address situations where some other factor, be it an environmental factor or a distant genetic locus, influences phenotype variance. We term this situation "background variance heterogeneity" (BVH) and used simulation to explore its effects on the power and false positive rate of tests for mean QTL, variance QTL, and mean-variance QTL. Specifically, we compared traditional tests, linear regression for mean QTL and Levene{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s test for variance QTL, with tests more recently developed, namely Cao{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s tests for all three types of QTL, and tests based on the double generalized linear model (DGLM), which, unlike the other approaches, explicitly models BVH. Simulations showed that, when used in conjunction with a permutation procedure, the DGLM-based tests accurately control false positive rate and are more powerful than the other tests. We also discovered that the rank-based inverse normal transform, often used to corral unruly phenotypes, can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of BVH in some circumstances. We applied the DGLM approach, which we term "mean-variance QTL mapping", to publicly available data on a mouse backcross of CAST/Ei into M16i and, after accommodating BVH driven by father, identified a new mean QTL for bodyweight at three weeks of age.},

	Abstract = {We illustrate, through two case studies, how quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping that jointly takes account of effects on trait mean and variance can discover QTL that standard approaches cannot. This approach, which we term "mean-variance QTL mapping", uses the double generalized linear model, an elaboration of the standard linear model, to capture structure in the residual variance. Its potential for use in QTL mapping has been described previously, but it remains underutilized, with certain key advantages undemonstrated until now. In the first case study, we use mean-variance QTL mapping to reanalyze a reduced complexity intercross of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice examining circadian behavior and find a mean-controlling QTL for circadian wheel running activity that is undetected by traditional methods. The discord between methods is due to variance effects at the QTL whereby the homozygous recessive genotype has markedly less residual variance than the other two. In the second case study, we reanalyze an intercross between C57BL/6J and C58/J mice examining anxiety-like behaviors, and identify a variance-controlling QTL for rearing behavior.},

@article{Soave2017,
	Abstract = {We generalize Levene's test for variance (scale) heterogeneity between k groups for more complex data, when there are sample correlation and group membership uncertainty. Following a two-stage regression framework, we show that least absolute deviation regression must be used in the stage 1 analysis to ensure a correct asymptotic $\chi$k-12/(k-1) distribution of the generalized scale (gS) test statistic. We then show that the proposed gS test is independent of the generalized location test, under the joint null hypothesis of no mean and no variance heterogeneity. Consequently, we generalize the recently proposed joint location-scale (gJLS) test, valuable in settings where there is an interaction effect but one interacting variable is not available. We evaluate the proposed method via an extensive simulation study and two genetic association application studies.},

@article{Soave2015,
	Abstract = {Gene-based, pathway, and other multivariate association methods are motivated by the possibility of GxG and GxE interactions; however, accounting for such interactions is limited by the challenges associated with adequate modeling information. Here we propose an easy-to-implement joint location-scale (JLS) association testing framework for single-variant and multivariate analysis that accounts for interactions without explicitly modeling them. We apply the JLS method to a gene-set analysis of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, which is influenced by multiple environmental and genetic factors. We identify and replicate an association between the constituents of the apical plasma membrane and CF lung disease (p = 0.0099 and p = 0.0180, respectively) and highlight a role for the SLC9A3-SLC9A3R1/2-EZR complex in contributing to CF lung disease. Many association studies could benefit from re-analysis with the JLS method that leverages complex genetic architecture for SNP, gene, and pathway identification. Analytical verification, simulation, and additional proof-of-principle applications support our approach.},

@article{Purcell07,
	Abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},
