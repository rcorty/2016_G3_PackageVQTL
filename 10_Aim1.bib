abstract = {Quantitative genetics has primarily focused on describing genetic effects on trait means and largely ignored the effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, potentially missing an important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences among individuals. To study the genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used Drosophila inbred lines and measured the spontaneous locomotor behavior of flies walking individually in Y-shaped mazes, focusing on variability in locomotor handedness, an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals, whereas lines with low variability behaved as although they tossed a coin at each left/right turn decision. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicates a neuropil in the central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor coordination. We validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. Our study reveals the constellation of phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and shows that different genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic variabililty. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important links between genotype and phenotype.},

abstract = {In experimental psychology, it is usually difficult to show that the populations sampled meet the requirements for the use of t or F tests or if they are similar to populations sampled in Monte Carlo experiments designed to demonstrate the robustness of these parametric tests. Consequently, a test that makes weaker requirements without sacrificing power or versatility should be preferred. The present study showed that this is true of modified approximate randomization tests that use observed scores to set up a sampling distribution. The tests are versatile, and results of Monte Carlo experiments indicate that their power approximates that of the F test. It is concluded that the approximate randomization test is preferable to an F test for ANOVA designs. (24 ref) (PsycLIT Database Copyright 1982 American Psychological Assn, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Robustness is characterized by the invariant expression of a phenotype in the face of a genetic and/or environmental perturbation. Although phenotypic variance is a central measure in the mapping of the genotype and environment to the phenotype in quantitative evolutionary genetics, robustness is also a key feature in systems biology, resulting from nonlinearities in quantitative relationships between upstream and downstream components. In this Review, we provide a synthesis of these two lines of investigation, converging on understanding how variation propagates across biological systems. We critically assess the recent proliferation of studies identifying robustness-conferring genes in the context of the nonlinearity in biological systems.},

abstract = {Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have established convincing relationships between genetic variants and gene expression. Most of these studies focused on the mean of gene expression level, but not the variance of gene expression level (i.e., gene expression variability). In the present study, we systematically explore genome-wide association between genetic variants and gene expression variability in humans. We adapt the double generalized linear model (dglm) to simultaneously fit the means and the variances of gene expression among the three possible genotypes of a biallelic SNP. The genomic loci showing significant association between the variances of gene expression and the genotypes are termed expression variability QTL (evQTL). Using a data set of gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 210 HapMap individuals, we identify cis-acting evQTL involving 218 distinct genes, among which 8 genes, ADCY1, CTNNA2, DAAM2, FERMT2, IL6, PLOD2, SNX7, and TNFRSF11B, are cross-validated using an extra expression data set of the same LCLs. We also identify ∼300 trans-acting evQTL between {\textgreater}13,000 common SNPs and 500 randomly selected representative genes. We employ two distinct scenarios, emphasizing single-SNP and multiple-SNP effects on expression variability, to explain the formation of evQTL. We argue that detecting evQTL may represent a novel method for effectively screening for genetic interactions, especially when the multiple-SNP influence on expression variability is implied. The implication of our results for revealing genetic mechanisms of gene expression variability is discussed.},

abstract = {As Arabidopsis thaliana has colonized a wide range of habitats across the world it is an attractive model for studying the genetic mechanisms underlying environmental adaptation. Here, we used public data from two collections of A. thaliana accessions to associate genetic variability at individual loci with differences in climates at the sampling sites. We use a novel method to screen the genome for plastic alleles that tolerate a broader climate range than the major allele. This approach reduces confounding with population structure and increases power compared to standard genome-wide association methods. Sixteen novel loci were found, including an association between Chromomethylase 2 (CMT2) and temperature seasonality where the genome-wide CHH methylation was different for the group of accessions carrying the plastic allele. Cmt2 mutants were shown to be more tolerant to heat-stress, suggesting genetic regulation of epigenetic modifications as a likely mechanism underlying natural adaptation to variable temperatures, potentially through differential allelic plasticity to temperature-stress.},

Possible confounding influences of the laboratory environment were studied in several inbred strains and one null mutant by simultaneous testing in three laboratories on a battery of six behaviors. Apparatus, test protocols, and many environmental variables were rigorously equated. Strains differed markedly in all behaviors, and despite standardization, there were systematic differences in behavior across labs.

abstract = {In human diseases related to tumor-suppressor genes, it is suggested that only the complete loss of the protein results in specific symptoms such as tumor formation, whereas simple reduction of protein quantity to 50{\%}, called haploinsufficiency, essentially does not affect cellular behavior. Using a model of gene expression, it was presumed that haploinsufficiency is related to an increased noise in gene expression also in vivo [Cook, D. L., Gerber, A. N. {\&} Tapscott, S. J. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 15641-15646]. Here, we demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of the tumor-suppressor gene neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) results in an increased variation of dendrite formation in cultured NF1 melanocytes. These morphological differences between NF1 and control melanocytes can be described by a mathematical model in which the cell is considered to be a self-organized automaton. The model describes the adjustment of the cells to a set point and includes a noise term that allows for stochastic processes. It describes the experimental data of control and NF1 melanocytes. In the cells haploinsufficient for NF1 we found an altered signal-to-noise ratio detectable as increased variation in dendrite formation in two of three investigated morphological parameters. We also suggest that in vivo NF1 haploinsufficiency results in an increased noise in cellular regulation and that this effect of haploinsufficiency may be found also in other tumor suppressors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sensitivity to microenvironmental changes varies among animals and may be under genetic control. It is essential to take this element into account when aiming at breeding robust farm animals. Here, linear mixed models with genetic effects in the residual variance part of the model can be used. Such models have previously been fitted using EM and MCMC algorithms. RESULTS: We propose the use of double hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLM), where the squared residuals are assumed to be gamma distributed and the residual variance is fitted using a generalized linear model. The algorithm iterates between two sets of mixed model equations, one on the level of observations and one on the level of variances. The method was validated using simulations and also by re-analyzing a data set on pig litter size that was previously analyzed using a Bayesian approach. The pig litter size data contained 10,060 records from 4,149 sows. The DHGLM was implemented using the ASReml software and the algorithm converged within three minutes on a Linux server. The estimates were similar to those previously obtained using Bayesian methodology, especially the variance components in the residual variance part of the model. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that variance components in the residual variance part of a linear mixed model can be estimated using a DHGLM approach. The method enables analyses of animal models with large numbers of observations. An important future development of the DHGLM methodology is to include the genetic correlation between the random effects in the mean and residual variance parts of the model as a parameter of the DHGLM.},

abstract = {Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperones the maturation of many regulatory proteins and, in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, buffers genetic variation in morphogenetic pathways. Levels and patterns of genetic variation differ greatly between obligatorily outbreeding species such as fruitflies and self-fertilizing species such as the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Also, plant development is more plastic, being coupled to environmental cues. Here we report that, in Arabidopsis accessions and recombinant inbred lines, reducing Hsp90 function produces an array of morphological phenotypes, which are dependent on underlying genetic variation. The strength and breadth of Hsp90's effects on the buffering and release of genetic variation suggests it may have an impact on evolutionary processes. We also show that Hsp90 influences morphogenetic responses to environmental cues and buffers normal development from destabilizing effects of stochastic processes. Manipulating Hsp90's buffering capacity offers a tool for harnessing cryptic genetic variation and for elucidating the interplay between genotypes, environments and stochastic events in the determination of phenotype.},

abstract = {Phenotypic robustness, or canalization, has been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically. However, it remains unknown to what extent robustness varies between individuals, and whether factors buffering environmental variation also buffer genetic variation. Here we introduce a quantitative genetic approach to these issues, and apply this approach to data from three species. In mice, we find suggestive evidence that for hundreds of gene expression traits, robustness is polymorphic and can be genetically mapped to discrete genomic loci. Moreover, we find that the polymorphisms buffering genetic variation are distinct from those buffering environmental variation. In fact, these two classes have quite distinct mechanistic bases: environmental buffers of gene expression are predominantly sex-specific and trans-acting, whereas genetic buffers are not sex-specific and often cis-acting. Data from studies of morphological and life-history traits in plants and yeast support the distinction between polymorphisms buffering genetic and environmental variation, and further suggest that loci buffering different types of environmental variation do overlap with one another. These preliminary results suggest that naturally occurring polymorphisms affecting phenotypic robustness could be abundant, and that these polymorphisms may generally buffer either genetic or environmental variation, but not both.},

abstract = {Genetic loci for body weight and subphenotypes such as fat weight have been mapped repeatedly. However, the distinct effects of different loci and physiological interactions among different traits are often not accounted for in mapping studies. Here we used the method of structural equation modeling to identify the specific relationships between genetic loci and different phenotypes influencing body weight. Using this technique, we were able to distinguish genetic loci that affect adiposity from those that affect muscle growth. We examined the high body weight-selected mouse lines NMRI8 and DU6i and the intercross populations NMRI8 x DBA/2 and DU6i x DBA/2. Structural models help us understand whether genetic factors affect lean mass and fat mass pleiotropically or nonpleiotropically. Sex has direct effects on both fat and muscle weight but also influences fat weight indirectly via muscle weight. Three genetic loci identified in these two crosses showed exclusive effects on fat deposition, and five loci contributed exclusively to muscle weight. Two additional loci showed pleiotropic effects on fat and muscle weight, with one locus acting in both crosses. Fat weight and muscle weight were influenced by epistatic effects. We provide evidence that significant fat loci in strains selected for body weight contribute to fat weight both directly and indirectly via the influence on lean weight. These results shed new light on the action of genes in quantitative trait locus regions potentially influencing muscle and fat mass and thus controlling body weight as a composite trait.},

abstract = {The expression of a gene can vary across individuals in the general population, as well as between monozygotic twins. This variable expression is assumed to be due to the influence of both genetic and nongenetic factors. Yet little evidence supporting this assumption has been obtained from empirical data. In this study, we used expression data from a large twin cohort to investigate the influences of genetic and nongenetic factors on variable gene expression. We focused on a set of expression variability QTL (evQTL)--i.e., genetic loci associated with the variance, as opposed to the mean, of gene expression. We identified evQTL for 99, 56, and 79 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines, skin, and fat, respectively. The differences in gene expression, measured by the relative mean difference (RMD), tended to be larger between pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins than between pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins, showing that genetic background influenced the expression variability. Furthermore, a more profound RMD was observed between pairs of MZ twins whose genotypes were associated with greater expression variability than the RMD found between pairs of MZ twins whose genotypes were associated with smaller expression variability. This suggests that nongenetic (e.g., environmental) factors contribute to the variable expression. Lastly, we demonstrated that the formation of evQTL is likely due to partial linkages between eQTL SNPs that are additively associated with the mean of gene expression; in most cases, no epistatic effect is involved. Our findings have implications for understanding divergent sources of gene expression variability.},

The genomic model commonly found in the literature, with marker effects affecting mean only, is extended to investigate putative effects at the level of the environmental variance. Two classes of models are proposed and their behaviour, studied using simulated data, indicates that they are capable of detecting genetic variation at the level of mean and variance. Implementation is via Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithms. The models are compared in terms of a measure of global fit, in their ability to detect QTL effects and in terms of their predictive power. The models are subsequently fitted to back fat thickness data in pigs. The analysis of back fat thickness shows that the data support genomic models with effects on the mean but not on the variance. The relative sizes of experiment necessary to detect effects on mean and variance is discussed and an extension of the McMC algorithm is proposed.},

In the 1940s, Conrad Hal Waddington coined the concept and term “canalization” to describe the robustness of phenotypes to perturbation; a similar concept was proposed by Waddington's contemporary Ivan Ivanovich Schmal- hausen. This paper reviews what has been learned about canalization sinceWaddington. Canalization implies that a genotype's phenotype remains relatively invariant when individuals of a particular genotype are exposed to different environments (environmental canalization) or when individuals of the same single- or multilocus genotype differ in their genetic background (genetic canalization). Con- sequently, genetic canalization can be viewed as a particular kind of epistasis, and environmental canalization and phenotypic plasticity are two aspects of the same phenomenon. Canalization results in the accumulation of phenotypically cryptic genetic variation, which can be released after a “decan- alizing” event. Thus, canalized genotypes maintain a cryptic potential for expressing particular phe- notypes, which are only uncovered under particular decanalizing environmental or genetic conditions. Selection may then act on this newly released genetic variation. The accumulation of cryptic genetic variation by canalization may therefore increase evolvability at the population level by leading to phenotypic diversification under decanalizing conditions. On the other hand, under canalizing con- ditions, a major part of the segregating genetic variation may remain phenotypically cryptic; canalization may therefore, at least temporarily, constrain phenotypic evolution. Mechanistically, canalization can be understood in terms of transmission patterns, such as epistasis, pleiotropy, and genotype by environment interactions, and in terms of genetic redundancy, modularity, and emergent properties of gene networks and biochemical pathways. While different forms of selection can favor canalization, the requirements for its evolution are typically rather restrictive. Although there are several methods to detect canalization, there are still serious problems with unambiguously demonstrating canalization, particularly its adaptive value.},

abstract = {The question of what significance threshold is appropriate for genomewide association studies is somewhat unresolved. Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the UK Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5{\%} family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 {\^{A}} 10 {\`{A}}8 . To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population.

abstract = {Understanding why organisms vary in developmental plasticity has
implications for predicting population responses to changing
environments and the maintenance of intraspecific variation. The
epiphenotype hypothesis posits that the timing of development
can constrain plasticity-the earlier alternate phenotypes begin
to develop, the greater the difference that can result amongst
the final traits. This research extends this idea by considering
how life history timing shapes the opportunity for the
environment to influence trait development. We test the
prediction that the earlier an individual begins to actively
interact with and explore their environment, the greater the
opportunity for plasticity and thus variation in foraging
traits. This research focuses on life history variation across
four groups of birds using museum specimens and measurements
from the literature. We reasoned that greater phenotypic
plasticity, through either environmental effects or
genotype-by-environment interactions in development, would be
manifest in larger trait ranges (bills and tarsi) within
species. Among shorebirds and ducks, we found that species with
relatively shorter incubation times tended to show greater
phenotypic variation. Across warblers and sparrows, we found
little support linking timing of flight and trait variation.
Overall, our results also suggest a pattern between body size
and trait variation, consistent with constraints on egg size
that might result in larger species having more environmental
influences on development. Taken together, our results provide
some support for the hypothesis that variation in life histories
affects how the environment shapes development, through either
the expression of plasticity or the release of cryptic genetic
variation.},

A simple interface allows the user to query for differential gene expression either (i) by gene names or attributes such as Gene Ontology terms, or (ii) by biological conditions, e.g. diseases, organism parts or cell types. The gene queries return the conditions where expression has been reported, while condition queries return which genes are reported to be expressed in these conditions. A combination of both query types is possible. The query results are ranked using various statistical measures and by how many independent studies in the database show the particular gene-condition association. Currently, the database contains information about more than 200,000 genes from nine species and almost 4500 biological conditions studied in over 30,000 assays from over 1000 independent studies.},

Nowadays, fiber diameter is considered the main selection objective in alpaca populations throughout the world. However, fiber diameter increases with the age of the animals, and it would be preferable to select those animals that maintain a thin fiber throughout their life span. The goal of this study was to describe the genetic relationship between fiber diameter at weaning age (6 mo) and the evolution of fiber diameter along the life span. The analysis of the evolution of fiber diameter was studied as a useful model for canalization and as a longitudinal trait by hierarchical Bayesian analysis. The results suggested that substantial genetic variation exists for fiber diameter and also for the variability and linear growth of the fiber diameter. Thus, a genetic selection program is plausible to modify the evolution of fiber diameter with time, together with a favorable correlated decrease in fiber diameter.},

abstract = {Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have indicated that SNPs on a chromosome 16 locus encompassing FTO, as well as IRX3, 5, 6, FTM and FTL are robustly associated with human obesity. GWAS, however, are by nature gene agnostic, and SNPs reaching the appropriate statistical threshold for a given phenotype can appear anywhere in the genome, within, near or far away from any coding sequence. Thus a major challenge in the field has been to translate these statistical hits into real biological insight. The key question is which of these genes are responsible for the association with obesity, and what is the underlying mechanism? With loss of function FTO mutations in both mice and humans resulting in severe growth retardation and mice globally over-expressing FTO being obese, the initial attention was focussed on this gene. We and others have shown that in vitro, recombinant FTO is able to catalyse the Fe(II)- and 2OG-dependent demethylation of single stranded nucleic-acids, with a preference for RNA. We have shown that FTO expression is regulated by essential amino acids (AAs) and that it couples amino acid levels to mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, through a mechanism dependent on its ability to demethylate. Thus FTO is an AA sensor and plays a key role regulating appropriate growth and translation. However, recent data focussing on obesity associated variants within FTO have implicated two neighbouring genes, RPGRIP1L and IRX3, as having a functional link between the SNP and the observed human phenotypes. As with Fto, perturbing the expression of these genes in mice results in a bodyweight phenotype, with homozygous deletion of Irx3 resulting in a smaller mouse and heterozygous deletion of Rpgrip1l leading to a mild obesity phenotype. Thus it may be that a number of genes in this region play an important role in determining body composition.},

abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N ≤ 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N ≤ 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},

abstract = {Trait uniformity, or micro-environmental sensitivity, may be studied through individual differences in residual variance. These differences appear to be heritable, and the need exists, therefore, to fit models to predict breeding values explaining differences in residual variance. The aim of this paper is to estimate breeding values for micro-environmental sensitivity (vEBV) in milk yield and somatic cell score, and their associated variance components, on a large dairy cattle data set having more than 1.6 million records. Estimation of variance components, ordinary breeding values, and vEBV was performed using standard variance component estimation software (ASReml), applying the methodology for double hierarchical generalized linear models. Estimation using ASReml took less than 7 d on a Linux server. The genetic standard deviations for residual variance were 0.21 and 0.22 for somatic cell score and milk yield, respectively, which indicate moderate genetic variance for residual variance and imply that a standard deviation change in vEBV for one of these traits would alter the residual variance by 20{\%}. This study shows that estimation of variance components, estimated breeding values and vEBV, is feasible for large dairy cattle data sets using standard variance component estimation software. The possibility to select for uniformity in Holstein dairy cattle based on these estimates is discussed.},

abstract = {Motivation Identifying variants, both discrete and continuous, that are associated with quantitative traits, or QTs, is the primary focus of quantitative genetics. Most current methods are limited to identifying mean effects, or associations between genotype or covariates and the mean value of a quantitative trait. It is possible, however, that a variant may affect the variance of the quantitative trait in lieu of, or in addition to, affecting the trait mean. Here, we develop a general methodology to identify covariates with variance effects on a quantitative trait using a Bayesian heteroskedastic linear regression model (BTH). We compare BTH with existing methods to detect variance effects across a large range of simulations drawn from scenarios common to the analysis of quantitative traits. Results We find that BTH and a double generalized linear model (dglm) outperform classical tests used for detecting variance effects in recent genomic studies. We show BTH and dglm are less likely to generate spurious discoveries through simulations and application to identifying methylation variance QTs and expression variance QTs. We identify four variance effects of sex in the Cardiovascular and Pharmacogenetics study. Impact Our work is the first to offer a comprehensive view of variance identifying methodology.We identify shortcomings in previously used methodology and provide a more conservative and robust alternative. We extend variance effect analysis to a wide array of covariates that enables a new statistical dimension in the study of sex and age specific quantitative trait effects.

abstract = {The Haley-Knott (HK) regression method continues to be a popular approximation to standard interval mapping (IM) of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in experimental crosses. The HK method is favored for its dramatic reduction in computation time compared to the IM method, something that is particularly important in simultaneous searches for multiple interacting QTL. While the HK method often approximates the IM method well in estimating QTL effects and in power to detect QTL, it may perform poorly if, for example, there is strong epistasis between QTL or if QTL are linked. Also, it is well known that the estimation of the residual variance by the HK method is biased. Here, we present an extension of the HK method that uses estimating equations based on both means and variances. For normally distributed phenotypes this estimating equation (EE) method is more efficient than the HK method. Furthermore, computer simulations show that the EE method performs well for very different genetic models and data set structures, including nonnormal phenotype distributions, nonrandom missing data patterns, varying degrees of epistasis, and varying degrees of linkage between QTL. The EE method retains key qualities of the HK method such as computational speed and robustness against nonnormal phenotype distributions, while approximating the IM method better in terms of accuracy and precision of parameter estimates and power to detect QTL.},

Telomerase is, in turn, regulated by post-translational modifications of the rate-limiting catalytic subunit hTERT. Here we show that disruption of Hsp90 by geldanamycin promotes efficient ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of hTERT. Furthermore, we have used the yeast two-hybrid method to identify a novel RING finger gene (MKRN1) encoding an E3 ligase that mediates ubiquitination of hTERT. Overexpression of MKRN1 in telomerase-positive cells promotes the degradation of hTERT and decreases telomerase activity and subsequently telomere length. Our data suggest that MKRN1 plays an important role in modulating telomere length homeostasis through a dynamic balance involving hTERT protein stability.},

We mapped a single causative locus and identified a nonsynonymous mutation of serine to phenylalanine (S968F) in Cytoplasmic FMRP interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) as the causative variant. The S968F mutation destabilizes CYFIP2, and deletion of the C57BL/6N mutant allele leads to acute and sensitized cocaine-response phenotypes.

Personality can and does change: at any given age or life stage it is contingent upon a wide range of experiential factors that occurred earlier in life, from prior to conception through adulthood. We show how developmental reaction norms that describe the effects of prior experience on a given behaviour can be used to determine whether the effects of a given experience at a given age will affect contextual generality at a later age, and to illustrate how variation within individuals in developmental plasticity leads to variation in contextual generality across individuals as a function of experience. We also show why niche-picking and niche-construction, behavioural processes which allow individuals to affect their own developmental environment, can affect the contextual generality and the temporal consistency of personality. We conclude by discussing how an appreciation of developmental processes can alert behavioural ecologists studying animal personality to critical, untested assumptions that underlie their own research programmes, and outline situations in which a developmental perspective can improve studies of the functional significance and evolution of animal personality.},

Genetic variation in residual variance may be utilised to improve uniformity in livestock populations by selection. The objective was to investigate the effects of genetic parameters, breeding goal, number of progeny per sire and breeding scheme on selection responses in mean and variance when applying index selection. Genetic parameters were obtained from the literature. Economic values for the mean and variance were derived for some standard non-linear profit equations, e.g. for traits with an intermediate optimum. The economic value of variance was in most situations negative, indicating that selection for reduced variance increases profit. Predicted responses in residual variance after one generation of selection were large, in some cases when the number of progeny per sire was at least 50, by more than 10{\%} of the current residual variance. Progeny testing schemes were more efficient than sib-testing schemes in decreasing residual variance. With optimum traits, selection pressure shifts gradually from the mean to the variance when approaching the optimum. Genetic improvement of uniformity is particularly interesting for traits where the current population mean is near an intermediate optimum.},

abstract = {The genetic control of common traits is rarely deterministic, with many genes contributing only to the chance of developing a given phenotype. This incomplete penetrance is poorly understood and is usually attributed to interactions between genes or interactions between genes and environmental conditions. Because many traits such as cancer can emerge from rare events happening in one or very few cells, we speculate an alternative and complementary possibility where some genotypes could facilitate these events by increasing stochastic cell-to-cell variations (or 'noise'). As a very first step towards investigating this possibility, we studied how natural genetic variation influences the level of noise in the expression of a single gene using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system. Reproducible differences in noise were observed between divergent genetic backgrounds. We found that noise was highly heritable and placed under a complex genetic control. Scanning the genome, we mapped three Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) of noise, one locus being explained by an increase in noise when transcriptional elongation was impaired. Our results suggest that the level of stochasticity in particular molecular regulations may differ between multicellular individuals depending on their genotypic background. The complex genetic architecture of noise buffering couples genetic to non-genetic robustness and provides a molecular basis to the probabilistic nature of complex traits.},

However, in the age of whole-genome sequences, physical distances measured in base pairs of DNA provide the standard coordinates for navigating the myriad features of genomes. Although genetic and physical maps are colinear, there are well-characterized and sometimes dramatic heterogeneities in the average frequency of meiotic recombination events that occur along the physical extent of chromosomes. There also are documented differences in the recombination landscape between the two sexes. We have revisited high-resolution genetic map data from a large heterogeneous mouse population and have constructed a revised genetic map of the mouse genome, incorporating 10,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms using a set of 47 families comprising 3546 meioses. The revised map provides a different picture of recombination in the mouse from that reported previously. We have further integrated the genetic and physical maps of the genome and incorporated SSLP markers from other genetic maps into this new framework. We demonstrate that utilization of the revised genetic map improves QTL mapping, partially due to the resolution of previously undetected errors in marker ordering along the chromosome.},

We review evidence for the presence of genetic variation in VE and estimates of its magnitude. Typically the heritability of VE is under 10{\%}, but its genetic coefficient of variation is typically 20{\%} or more. We consider experimental designs appropriate for estimating genetic variance in VE and review alternative methods of estimation. We consider the effects of stabilizing and directional selection on VE and review both the forces that might be maintaining levels of VE and heritability found in populations.

@article{Wagner1997,
abstract = {Canalization is the suppression of phenotypic variation. Depending on the causes of phenotypic variation, one speaks either of genetic or environmental canalization. Genetic canalization describes insensitivity of a character to mutations, and the insensitivity to environmental factors is called environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is of interest because it influences the availability of heritable phenotypic variation to natural selection, and is thus potentially important in determining the pattern of phenotypic evolution. In this paper a number of population genetic models are considered of a quantitative character under stabilizing selection. The main purpose of this study is to define the population genetic conditions and constraints for the evolution of canalization. Environmental canalization is modeled as genotype specific environmental variance. It is shown that stabilizing selection favors genes that decrease environmental variance of quantitative characters. However, the theoretical limit of zero environmental variance has never been observed. Of the many ways to explain this fact, two are addressed by our model. It is shown that a 'canalization limit' is reached if canalizing effects of mutations are correlated with direct effects on the same character. This canalization limit is predicted to be independent of the strength of stabilizing selection, which is inconsistent with recent experimental data (Sterns et al. 1995). The second model assumes that the canalizing genes have deleterious pleiotropic effects. If these deleterious effects are of the same magnitude as all the other mutations affecting fitness very strong stabilizing selection is required to allow the evolution of environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is modeled as an influence on the average effect of mutations at a locus of other genes. It is found that the selection for genetic canalization critically depends on the amount of genetic variation present in the population. The more genetic variation, the stronger the selection for canalizing effects. All factors that increase genetic variation favor the evolution of genetic canalization (large population size, high mutation rate, large number of genes). If genetic variation is maintained by mutation-selection balance, strong stabilizing selection can inhibit the evolution of genetic canalization. Strong stabilizing selection eliminates genetic variation to a level where selection for canalization does not work anymore. It is predicted that the most important characters (in terms of fitness) are not necessarily the most canalized ones, if they are under very strong stabilizing selection (k {\textgreater} 0.2 Ve). The rate of decrease of mutational variance Vm is found to be less than 10{\%} of the initial Vm. From this result it is concluded that characters with typical mutational variances of about 10-3 Ve are in a metastable state where further evolution of genetic canalization is too slow to be of importance at a microevolutionary time scale. The implications for the explanation of macroevolutionary patterns are discussed. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1997 Society for the Study of Evolution},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canalization is defined as the stability of a genotype against minor variations in both environment and genetics. Genetic variation in degree of canalization causes heterogeneity of within-family variance. The aims of this study are twofold: (1) quantify genetic heterogeneity of (within-family) residual variance in Atlantic salmon and (2) test whether the observed heterogeneity of (within-family) residual variance can be explained by simple scaling effects.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: Analysis of body weight in Atlantic salmon using a double hierarchical generalized linear model (DHGLM) revealed substantial heterogeneity of within-family variance. The 95{\%} prediction interval for within-family variance ranged from {\~{}}0.4 to 1.2 kg2, implying that the within-family variance of the most extreme high families is expected to be approximately three times larger than the extreme low families. For cross-sectional data, DHGLM with an animal mean sub-model resulted in severe bias, while a corresponding sire-dam model was appropriate. Heterogeneity of variance was not sensitive to Box-Cox transformations of phenotypes, which implies that heterogeneity of variance exists beyond what would be expected from simple scaling effects.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: Substantial heterogeneity of within-family variance was found for body weight in Atlantic salmon. A tendency towards higher variance with higher means (scaling effects) was observed, but heterogeneity of within-family variance existed beyond what could be explained by simple scaling effects. For cross-sectional data, using the animal mean sub-model in the DHGLM resulted in biased estimates of variance components, which differed substantially both from a standard linear mean animal model and a sire-dam DHGLM model. Although genetic differences in canalization were observed, selection for increased canalization is difficult, because there is limited individual information for the variance sub-model, especially when based on cross-sectional data. Furthermore, potential macro-environmental changes (diet, climatic region, etc.) may make genetic heterogeneity of variance a less stable trait over time and space.},

A substantial proportion of the twins were raised in families living near or below the poverty level. Biometric analyses were conducted using models allowing for components attributable to the additive effects of genotype, shared environment, and non-shared environment to interact with socioeconomic status (SES) measured as a continuous variable. Results demonstrate that the proportions of IQ variance attributable to genes and environment vary nonlinearly with SES. The models suggest that in impoverished families, 60{\%} of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse.},

abstract = {Intragenotypic variability (IGV) occurs when individuals with the same genotype, reared in the same environment and then tested under the same conditions, express different trait values. Game theoretical and bet-hedging models have suggested two ways that a single genotype might generate variable behaviour when behavioural variation is discrete rather than continuous: behavioural polyphenism (a genotype produces different types of individuals, each of which consistently expresses a different type of behaviour) or stochastic variability (a genotype produces one type of individual that randomly expresses different types of behaviour over time). We first demonstrated significant differences across 14 natural genotypes of male Drosophila melanogaster in the variability (as measured by entropy) of their microhabitat choice in an experiment in which each fly was allowed free access to four different types of habitat. We then tested four hypotheses about ways that within-individual variability might contribute to differences across genotypes in the variability of microhabitat choice. There was no empirical support for three hypotheses (behavioural polymorphism, consistent choice, or time-based choice), nor could our results be attributed to genotypic differences in activity levels. The stochastic variability hypothesis accurately predicted the slope and the intercept of the relationship across genotypes between entropy at the individual level and entropy at the genotype level. However, our initial version of the stochastic model slightly but significantly overestimated the values of individual entropy for each genotype, pointing to specific assumptions of this model that might need to be adjusted in future studies of the IGV of microhabitat choice. This is among a handful of recent studies to document genotypic differences in behavioural IGV, and the first to explore ways that genotypic differences in within-individual variability might contribute to differences among genotypes in the predictability of their behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We conclude that evolution should produce a single mode of canalization that will buffer the phenotype against all kinds of perturbation, and that the major fitness benefit driving the fixation of canalizing alleles derives from a reduction in environmental influences on phenotypic variation.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that a significant component of expression variability arises from extrinsic factors thought to influence multiple genes simultaneously, yet the biological origins of this extrinsic variability have received little attention. Here we combine computational modelling with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter-gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay of gene regulatory networks with population heterogeneity for understanding the origins of cellular diversity.},

In a forward selection strategy, non-interacting QTLs and simultaneously mapped interacting QTL pairs are added to a total genetic model. Simultaneous mapping of epistatic QTLs increases the power of the mapping strategy by allowing detection of interacting QTL pairs where none of the QTL can be detected by their marginal additive and dominance effects. Randomization testing is used to derive empirical significance thresholds for every model selection step in the procedure. A simulation study was used to evaluate the statistical properties of the proposed randomization tests and for which types of epistasis simultaneous mapping of epistatic QTLs adds power. Least squares regression was used for QTL parameter estimation but any other QTL mapping method can be used. A genetic algorithm was used to search for interacting QTL pairs, which makes the proposed strategy feasible for single processor computers. We believe that this method will facilitate the evaluation of the importance at epistatic interaction among QTLs controlling multifactorial traits and disorders.},

The complexity of genome-wide epistatic analysis results mainly from the number of QTL being unknown and the number of possible epistatic effects being huge. In this article, we use a composite model space approach to develop a Bayesian model selection framework for identifying epistatic QTL for complex traits in experimental crosses from two inbred lines. By placing a liberal constraint on the upper bound of the number of detectable QTL we restrict attention to models of fixed dimension, greatly simplifying calculations. Indicators specify which main and epistatic effects of putative QTL are included. We detail how to use prior knowledge to bound the number of detectable QTL and to specify prior distributions for indicators of genetic effects. We develop a computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm using the Gibbs sampler and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to explore the posterior distribution. We illustrate the proposed method by detecting new epistatic QTL for obesity in a backcross of CAST/Ei mice onto M16i.},

The Bayesian analyses indicate that genotype by location-year interactions are the most important effects acting at the level of the mean. The best-fitting Bayesian model is one postulating genotype by location-year interactions acting on the mean and main effects of genotype and of location-year on the variance. Despite the detection of genotypic effects acting on the variance, location-year effects constitute the biggest relative source of variance heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Quantitative genetics traces its roots back through more than a century of theory, largely formed in the absence of directly observable genotype data, and has remained essentially unchanged for decades. By contrast, molecular genetics arose from direct observations and is currently undergoing rapid changes, making the amount of available data ever greater. Thus, the two disciplines are disparate both in their origins and their current states, yet they address the same fundamental question: how does the genotype affect the phenotype? The rapidly accumulating genomic data necessitate sophisticated analysis, but many of the current tools are adaptations of methods designed during the early days of quantitative genetics. We argue here that the present analysis paradigm in quantitative genetics is at its limits in regards to unraveling complex traits and it is necessary to re-evaluate the direction that genetic research is taking for the field to realize its full potential. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Non-additive interaction between genetic variants, or epistasis, is a possible explanation for the gap between heritability of complex traits and the variation explained by identified genetic loci. Interactions give rise to genotype dependent variance, and therefore the identification of variance quantitative trait loci can be an intermediate step to discover both epistasis and gene by environment effects (GxE). Using RNA-sequence data from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from the TwinsUK cohort, we identify a candidate set of 508 variance associated SNPs. Exploiting the twin design we show that GxE plays a role in ∼70{\%} of these associations. Further investigation of these loci reveals 57 epistatic interactions that replicated in a smaller dataset, explaining on average 4.3{\%} of phenotypic variance. In 24 cases, more variance is explained by the interaction than their additive contributions. Using molecular phenotypes in this way may provide a route to uncovering genetic interactions underlying more complex traits.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01381.001.},

abstract = {Increasing uniformity of traits is an important objective in livestock production. This study focused on the BWcomparison of a double hierarchical GLM (DHGLM) with the conventional analysis of uniformity, using within-litter variation in birth weight (BW0) in pigs as a case. In pigs, within-litter variation of BW0 is a trait in which uniformity is important in breeding practice. Traditionally, uniformity has been studied by analysis of SD or variances. In DHGLM, differences between animals are studied by analyzing the residual variance of the trait and estimating its variance components. Here we used data on BW0, recorded in 2 sow lines (Large White and Landrace), to compare the estimation of genetic parameters and breeding values for uniformity from DHGLM and traditional analysis of the variance. Comparison of DHGLM with the conventional analysis using the logarithm-transformed variance of BW0 was possible because both methods were on the same scale and the models contained the same random effects. In addition, the genetic CV at the residual SD level (GCV) was proposed as a measure expressing the potential response to selection. Three-fold cross-validation was performed to study predictive ability of both methods. The estimated GCV was highly similar using both methods. Results indicate that the SD of BW0 can be decreased by up to approximately 10{\%} after 1 generation of selection, indicating good prospects for response to selection. The correlation between EBV (0.88 in both sow lines) obtained from both methods indicated high similarity between conventional analysis and DHGLM. Comparison of accuracies of EBV showed that the methods were comparable, with moderate accuracies achieved with approximately 100 piglets per maternal grandsire. Cross-validation also indicated very similar predictive ability in estimating EBV for BW0 variation for both methods. Therefore, it was concluded that conventional analysis and DHGLM produced highly comparable results. Still, the DHGLM potentially has a broader application than conventional analysis to study uniformity of traits, because it also can be used for traits with single observations per animal.},

abstract = {We studied the general problem of interpreting and detecting differences in phenotypic variability among the genotypes at a locus, from both a biological and a statistical point of view. The scales on which we measure interval-scale quantitative traits are man-made and have little intrinsic biological relevance. Before claiming a biological interpretation for genotype differences in variance, we should be sure that no monotonic transformation of the data can reduce or eliminate these differences. We show theoretically that for an autosomal diallelic SNP, when the three corresponding means are distinct so that the variance can be expressed as a quadratic function of the mean, there implicitly exists a transformation that will tend to equalize the three variances; we also demonstrate how to find a transformation that will do this. We investigate the validity of Bartlett's test, Box's modification of it, and a modified Levene's test to test for differences in variances when normality does not hold. We find that, although they may detect differences in variability, these tests do not necessarily detect differences in variance. The same is true for permutation tests that use these three statistics. ?? 2013 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {Searching for genetic variants involved in gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large-scale data raises multiple methodological issues. Many existing methods have focused on the problem of dimensionality, trying to explore the largest number of combinations between risk factors while considering simple interaction models. Despite evidence demonstrating the efficacy of these methods in simulated data, their application in real data has been unsuccessful so far. The classical test of a linear marginal genetic effect has been widely used for agnostic genome-wide association studies, with the underlying idea that most variants involved in interactions might display marginal effect on the phenotypic mean. Although this approach may allow for the identification of genetic variants involved in interactions in many scenarios, the linear marginal effects of some causal alleles on the phenotypic mean might not be always detectable at genome-wide significance level. We introduce in this study a general association test for quantitative trait loci that compare the distributions of phenotypic values by genotypic classes as opposed to most standard tests that compare phenotypic means by genotypic classes. Using simulations we show that in presence of interactions, this approach can be more powerful than the standard test of the linear marginal effect, with a gain of power increasing with increasing interaction effect and decreasing frequencies of the interacting exposures. We demonstrate the potential utility of our method on real data by analyzing mammographic density genome-wide data from the Nurses' Health Study.},

More recently large initiatives such as the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) are using the C57BL/6N mouse strain to generate null alleles for all mouse genes. Hence both strains are now widely used in mouse genetics studies. Here we perform a comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the two strains to identify differences that may influence their underlying genetic mechanisms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We undertake genome sequence comparisons of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N to identify SNPs, indels and structural variants, with a focus on identifying all coding variants. We annotate 34 SNPs and 2 indels that distinguish C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N coding sequences, as well as 15 structural variants that overlap a gene. In parallel we assess the comparative phenotypes of the two inbred lines utilizing the EMPReSSslim phenotyping pipeline, a broad based assessment encompassing diverse biological systems. We perform additional secondary phenotyping assessments to explore other phenotype domains and to elaborate phenotype differences identified in the primary assessment. We uncover significant phenotypic differences between the two lines, replicated across multiple centers, in a number of physiological, biochemical and behavioral systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Comparison of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N demonstrates a range of phenotypic differences that have the potential to impact upon penetrance and expressivity of mutational effects in these strains.

abstract = {We propose a mathematical model to analyze the evolution of canalization for a trait under stabilizing selection, where each individual in the population is randomly exposed to different environmental conditions, independently of its genotype. Without canalization, our trait (primary phenotype) is affected by both genetic variation and environmental perturbations (morphogenic environment). Selection of the trait depends on individually varying environmental conditions (selecting environment). Assuming no plasticity initially, morphogenic effects are not correlated with the direction of selection in individual environments. Under quite plausible assumptions we show that natural selection favors a system of canalization that tends to repress deviations from the phenotype that is optimal in the most common selecting environment. However, many experimental results, dating back to WADDINGTON and others, indicate that natural canalization systems may fail under extreme environments. While this can be explained as an impossibility of the system to cope with extreme morphogenic pressure, we show that a canalization system that tends to be inactivated in extreme environments is even more advantageous than rigid canalization. Moreover, once this adaptive canalization is established, the resulting evolution of primary phenotype enables substantial preadaptation to permanent environmental changes resembling extreme niches of the previous environment},

abstract = {Quantitative genetic analysis has long been used to study how natural variation of genotype can influence an organism's phenotype. While most studies have focused on genetic determinants of phenotypic average, it is rapidly becoming understood that stochastic noise is genetically determined. However, it is not known how many traits display genetic control of stochastic noise nor how broadly these stochastic loci are distributed within the genome. Understanding these questions is critical to our understanding of quantitative traits and how they relate to the underlying causal loci, especially since stochastic noise may be directly influenced by underlying changes in the wiring of regulatory networks. We identified QTLs controlling natural variation in stochastic noise of glucosinolates, plant defense metabolites, as well as QTLs for stochastic noise of related transcripts. These loci included stochastic noise QTLs unique for either transcript or metabolite variation. Validation of these loci showed that genetic polymorphism within the regulatory network alters stochastic noise independent of effects on corresponding average levels. We examined this phenomenon more globally, using transcriptomic datasets, and found that the Arabidopsis transcriptome exhibits significant, heritable differences in stochastic noise. Further analysis allowed us to identify QTLs that control genomic stochastic noise. Some genomic QTL were in common with those altering average transcript abundance, while others were unique to stochastic noise. Using a single isogenic population, we confirmed that natural variation at ELF3 alters stochastic noise in the circadian clock and metabolism. Since polymorphisms controlling stochastic noise in genomic phenotypes exist within wild germplasm for naturally selected phenotypes, this suggests that analysis of Arabidopsis evolution should account for genetic control of stochastic variance and average phenotypes. It remains to be determined if natural genetic variation controlling stochasticity is equally distributed across the genomes of other multi-cellular eukaryotes.},

abstract = {A number of recent works have introduced statistical methods for detecting genetic loci that affect phenotypic variability, which we refer to as variability-controlling quantitative trait loci (vQTL). These are genetic variants whose allelic state predicts how much phenotype values will vary about their expected means. Such loci are of great potential interest in both human and non-human genetic studies, one reason being that a detected vQTL could represent a previously undetected interaction with other genes or environmental factors. The simultaneous publication of these new methods in different journals has in many cases precluded opportunity for comparison. We survey some of these methods, the respective trade-offs they imply, and the connections between them. The methods fall into three main groups: classical non-parametric, fully parametric, and semi-parametric two-stage approximations. Choosing between alternatives involves balancing the need for robustness, flexibility, and speed. For each method, we identify important assumptions and limitations, including those of practical importance, such as their scope for including covariates and random effects. We show in simulations that both parametric methods and their semi-parametric approximations can give elevated false positive rates when they ignore mean-variance relationships intrinsic to the data generation process. We conclude that choice of method depends on the trait distribution, the need to include non-genetic covariates, and the population size and structure, coupled with a critical evaluation of how these fit with the assumptions of the statistical model.},

abstract = {Genotypic variability based genome-wide association studies (vGWASs) can identify potentially interacting loci without prior knowledge of the interacting factors. We report a two-stage approach to make vGWAS applicable to diseases: firstly using a mixed model approach to partition dichotomous phenotypes into additive risk and non-additive environmental residuals on the liability scale and secondly using the Levene's (Brown-Forsythe) test to assess equality of the residual variances across genotype groups per marker. We found widespread significant (P {\textless} 2.5e-05) vGWAS signals within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) across all three study cohorts of rheumatoid arthritis. We further identified 10 epistatic interactions between the vGWAS signals independent of the MHC additive effects, each with a weak effect but jointly explained 1.9{\%} of phenotypic variance. PTPN22 was also identified in the discovery cohort but replicated in only one independent cohort. Combining the three cohorts boosted power of vGWAS and additionally identified TYK2 and ANKRD55. Both PTPN22 and TYK2 had evidence of interactions reported elsewhere. We conclude that vGWAS can help discover interacting loci for complex diseases but require large samples to find additional signals.},

abstract = {Developmental stability and canalization describe the ability of
developmental systems to minimize phenotypic variation in the
face of stochastic micro-environmental effects, genetic
variation and environmental influences. Canalization is the
ability to minimize the effects of genetic or environmental
effects, whereas developmental stability is the ability to
minimize the effects of micro-environmental effects within
individuals. Despite much attention, the mechanisms that
underlie these two components of phenotypic robustness remain
unknown. We investigated the genetic structure of phenotypic
robustness in the collaborative cross (CC) mouse reference
population. We analysed the magnitude of fluctuating asymmetry
(FA) and among-individual variation of cranial shape in
reciprocal crosses among the eight parental strains, using
geometric morphometrics and a diallel analysis based on a
Bayesian approach. Significant differences among genotypes were
found for both measures, although they were poorly correlated at
the level of individuals. An overall positive effect of
inbreeding was found for both components of variation. The
strain CAST/EiJ exerted a positive additive effect on FA and, to
a lesser extent, among-individual variance. Sex- and other
strain-specific effects were not significant. Neither FA nor
among-individual variation was associated with phenotypic
extremeness. Our results support the existence of genetic
variation for both developmental stability and canalization.
This finding is important because robustness is a key feature of
developmental systems. Our finding that robustness is not
related to phenotypic extremeness is consistent with theoretical
work that suggests that its relationship to stabilizing
selection is not straightforward.},

abstract = {We consider hierarchical generalized linear models which allow extra error components in the linear predictors of generalized linear models. The distribution of these components is not restricted to be normal; this allows a broader class of models, which includes generalized linear mixed models. We use a generalization of Henderson's joint likelihood, called a hierarchical or h-likelihood, for inferences from hierarchical generalized linear models. This avoids the integration that is necessary when marginal likelihood is used. Under appropriate conditions maximizing the h-likelihood gives fixed effect estimators that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the use of marginal likelihood; at the same time we obtain the random effect estimates that are asymptotically best unbiased predictors. An adjusted profile h-likelihood is shown to give the required generalization of restricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of dispersion components. A scaled deviance test for the goodness of fit, a model selection criterion for choosing between various dispersion models and a graphical method for checking the distributional assumption of random effects are proposed. The ideas of quasi-likelihood and extended quasi-likelihood are generalized to the new class. We give examples of the Poisson-gamma, binomial-beta and gamma-inverse gamma hierarchical generalized linear models. A resolution is proposed for the apparent difference between population-averaged and subject-specific models. A unified framework is provided for viewing and extending many existing methods.},

This study, by using a population of maize recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphic markers, aims at the following: firstly, to quantify the genetic component of the V(E) or developmental stability for four traits in maize and the environmental correlation between these traits, and secondly, to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence these quantities. We found that, when estimating variances and correlations and testing their homogeneity, estimates and tests are needed that are not highly dependent on normality assumptions. There was significant variation among the RILs in V(E) and in the environmental correlation for some of the traits, implying genetic heterogeneity in the V(E) and environmental correlations. The genetic coefficient of variation of the environmental variance (GCV(V(E))) was estimated to be 20{\%}, which is lower than estimates obtained for other species. A few genomic regions involved in the stability of one trait or two traits were detected, and these did not have an important influence on the mean of the trait. One region that could be associated with the environmental correlations between traits was also detected.},

abstract = {Detection of gene-environment interactions using an exhaustive search necessarily raises the multiple hypothesis problem. While frequently used to control for experiment-wise type I error, Bonferroni correction is overly conservative and results in reduced statistical power. We have previously shown that prioritizing SNPs on the basis of heterogeneity in quantitative trait variance per genotype leads to increased power to detect genetic interactions. Our proposed method, variance prioritization (VP), selects SNPs having significant heterogeneity in variance per genotype using a pre-determined P-value threshold. We now suggest prioritizing SNPs individually such that the optimal heterogeneity of variance P-value is determined for each SNP. The large number of SNPs in genome-wide studies calls for a fast algorithm to output the optimal prioritization threshold for each SNP. In this report, we present such an algorithm, the Gene Environment Wide Interaction Search Threshold (GEWIST), and show that the use of GEWIST will increase power under a variety of interaction scenarios. Furthermore, by integrating over possible interaction effect sizes, we provide a framework to optimize prioritization in situations where interactions are a priori unknown. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Most QTL mapping approaches seek to identify "mean QTL", genetic loci that influence the phenotype mean, after assuming that all individuals in the mapping population have equal residual variance. Recent work has broadened the scope of QTL mapping to identify genetic loci that influence phenotype variance, termed "variance QTL", or some combination of mean and variance, which we term "mean-variance QTL". Even these approaches, however, fail to address situations where some other factor, be it an environmental factor or a distant genetic locus, influences phenotype variance. We term this situation "background variance heterogeneity" (BVH) and used simulation to explore its effects on the power and false positive rate of tests for mean QTL, variance QTL, and mean-variance QTL. Specifically, we compared traditional tests, linear regression for mean QTL and Levene{\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}textquoteright{\}}s test for variance QTL, with tests more recently developed, namely Cao{\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}textquoteright{\}}s tests for all three types of QTL, and tests based on the double generalized linear model (DGLM), which, unlike the other approaches, explicitly models BVH. Simulations showed that, when used in conjunction with a permutation procedure, the DGLM-based tests accurately control false positive rate and are more powerful than the other tests. We also discovered that the rank-based inverse normal transform, often used to corral unruly phenotypes, can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of BVH in some circumstances. We applied the DGLM approach, which we term "mean-variance QTL mapping", to publicly available data on a mouse backcross of CAST/Ei into M16i and, after accommodating BVH driven by father, identified a new mean QTL for bodyweight at three weeks of age.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many traits, not only individual trait levels are under genetic control, but also the variation around that level. In other words, genotypes do not only differ in mean, but also in (residual) variation around the genotypic mean. New statistical methods facilitate gaining knowledge on the genetic architecture of complex traits such as phenotypic variability. Here we study litter size (total number born) and its variation in a Large White pig population using a Double Hierarchical Generalized Linear model, and perform a genome-wide association study using a Bayesian method. RESULTS: In total, 10 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected for total number born (TNB) and 9 SNPs for variability of TNB (varTNB). Those SNPs explained 0.83 {\%} of genetic variance in TNB and 1.44 {\%} in varTNB. The most significant SNP for TNB was detected on Sus scrofa chromosome (SSC) 11. A possible candidate gene for TNB is ENOX1, which is involved in cell growth and survival. On SSC7, two possible candidate genes for varTNB are located. The first gene is coding a swine heat shock protein 90 (HSPCB = Hsp90), which is a well-studied gene stabilizing morphological traits in Drosophila and Arabidopsis. The second gene is VEGFA, which is activated in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the fetus. Furthermore, the genetic correlation between additive genetic effects on TNB and on its variation was 0.49. This indicates that the current selection to increase TNB will also increase the varTNB. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting SNPs associated with variation of a trait in pigs. Detected genomic regions associated with varTNB can be used in genomic selection to decrease varTNB, which is highly desirable to avoid very small or very large litters in pigs. However, the percentage of variance explained by those regions was small. The SNPs detected in this study can be used as indication for regions in the Sus scrofa genome involved in maintaining low variability of litter size, but further studies are needed to identify the causative loci.},

abstract = {Genetically tractable model organisms from phages to mice have taught us invaluable lessons about fundamental biological processes and disease-causing mutations. Owing to technological and computational advances, human biology and the causes of human diseases have become accessible as never before. Progress in identifying genetic determinants for human diseases has been most remarkable for Mendelian traits. In contrast, identifying genetic determinants for complex diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular and neurological diseases has remained challenging, despite the fact that these diseases cluster in families. Hundreds of variants associated with complex diseases have been found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), yet most of these variants explain only a modest amount of the observed heritability, a phenomenon known as "missing heritability." The missing heritability has been attributed to many factors, mainly inadequacies in genotyping and phenotyping. We argue that lessons learned about complex traits in model organisms offer an alternative explanation for missing heritability in humans. In diverse model organisms, phenotypic robustness differs among individuals, and those with decreased robustness show increased penetrance of mutations and express previously cryptic genetic variation. We propose that phenotypic robustness also differs among humans and that individuals with lower robustness will be more responsive to genetic and environmental perturbations and hence susceptible to disease. Phenotypic robustness is a quantitative trait that can be accurately measured in model organisms, but not as yet in humans. We propose feasible approaches to measure robustness in large human populations, proof-of-principle experiments for robustness markers in model organisms, and a new GWAS design that takes differences in robustness into account.},

abstract = {We illustrate, through two case studies, how quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping that jointly takes account of effects on trait mean and variance can discover QTL that standard approaches cannot. This approach, which we term "mean-variance QTL mapping", uses the double generalized linear model, an elaboration of the standard linear model, to capture structure in the residual variance. Its potential for use in QTL mapping has been described previously, but it remains underutilized, with certain key advantages undemonstrated until now. In the first case study, we use mean-variance QTL mapping to reanalyze a reduced complexity intercross of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N mice examining circadian behavior and find a mean-controlling QTL for circadian wheel running activity that is undetected by traditional methods. The discord between methods is due to variance effects at the QTL whereby the homozygous recessive genotype has markedly less residual variance than the other two. In the second case study, we reanalyze an intercross between C57BL/6J and C58/J mice examining anxiety-like behaviors, and identify a variance-controlling QTL for rearing behavior.},

abstract = {Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is used to discover the genetic and molecular architecture underlying complex quantitative traits. It has important applications in agricultural, evolutionary, andbiomedical research. R/qtl is an extensible, interactive environment for QTL mapping inexperimental crosses. It is implemented as a package for the widely used open source statistical software R and contains a diverse array of QTL mapping methods, diagnostic tools for ensuring high-quality data, and facilities for the fit and exploration of multiple-QTL models, including QTL x QTL and QTL x environment interactions. This book is a comprehensive guide to the practice of QTL mapping and the use of R/qtl, including study design, data import and simulation, data diagnostics, interval mapping and generalizations, two-dimensional genome scans, and the consideration of complexmultiple-QTL models. Two moderately challenging case studies illustrate QTL analysis in its entirety.The book alternates between QTL mapping theory and examples illustrating the use of R/qtl. Novice readers will find detailed explanations of the important statistical concepts and, through theextensive software illustrations, will be able to apply these concepts in their own research. Experienced readers will find details on the underlying algorithms and the implementation of extensions to R/qtl. There are 150 figures, including 90 in full color.},

Inspired by behavioral-genetic investigations of human monozygotic twins reared together, we obtained dense longitudinal activity data on 40 inbred mice living in one large enriched environment. The exploratory activity of the mice diverged over time, resulting in increasing individual differences with advancing age. Individual differences in cumulative roaming entropy, indicating the active coverage of territory, correlated positively with individual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results show that factors unfolding or emerging during development contribute to individual differences in structural brain plasticity and behavior.

That is, development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. It has been claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. We show that the developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. The extent of canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. We argue that canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex developmental-genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Quantitative trait locus analysis has been used as an important tool to identify markers where the phenotype or quantitative trait is linked with the genotype. Most existing tests for single locus association with quantitative traits aim at the detection of the mean differences across genotypic groups. However, recent research has revealed functional genetic loci that affect the variance of traits, known as variability-controlling quantitative trait locus. In addition, it has been suggested that many genotypes have both mean and variance effects, while the mean effects or variance effects alone may not be strong enough to be detected. The existing methods accounting for unequal variances include the Levene's test, the Lepage test, and the D-test, but suffer from their limitations of lack of robustness or lack of power. We propose a semiparametric model and a novel pairwise conditional likelihood ratio test. Specifically, the semiparametric model is designed to identify the combined differences in higher moments among genotypic groups. The pairwise likelihood is constructed based on conditioning procedure, where the unknown reference distribution is eliminated. We show that the proposed pairwise likelihood ratio test has a simple asymptotic chi-square distribution, which does not require permutation or bootstrap procedures. Simulation studies show that the proposed test performs well in controlling Type I errors and having competitive power in identifying the differences across genotypic groups. In addition, the proposed test has certain robustness to model mis-specifications. The proposed test is illustrated by an example of identifying both mean and variances effects in body mass index using the Framingham Heart Study data.},

Mean and dispersion submodels are formulated for this, the dependent variable for the dispersion submodel being the deviance components of the mean submodel. The fact that both submodels are essentially generalized linear models themselves is used to derive simple expressions for the likelihood equations and for asymptotic tests. Estimation algorithms are proposed which have good convergence properties. The results apply mainly to the normal, inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions but can be extended to discrete distributions by using quasi-likelihoods. The methods developed are applied to a well-known data set.},

exposed to the same environmental condition are often noted in
genetic studies. Despite this commonplace observation, little is
known about the causes of this variability, which has been
termed microenvironmental plasticity. One possibility is that
stochastic or technical sources of variance produce these
differences. A second possibility is that this variation has a
genetic component. We have explored gene expression robustness
in the transcriptomes of 730 individual Drosophila melanogaster
of 16 fixed genotypes, nine of which are infected with Wolbachia
Three replicates of flies were grown, controlling for food,
day/night cycles, humidity, temperature, sex, mating status,
social exposure, and circadian timing of RNA extraction. Despite
the use of inbred genotypes, and carefully controlled
experimental conditions, thousands of genes were differentially
expressed, revealing a unique and dynamic transcriptional
signature for each individual fly. We found that 23{\%} of the
transcriptome was differentially expressed among individuals,
and that the variability in gene expression among individuals is
influenced by genotype. This transcriptional variation
originated from specific gene pathways, suggesting a plastic
response to the microenvironment; but there was also evidence of
gene expression differences due to stochastic fluctuations.
These observations reveal previously unappreciated genetic
sources of variability in gene expression among individuals,
which has implications for complex trait genetics and precision

The robustness, or uniformity, of an individual's character is not only of great practical importance in medical genetics and food production but is also of scientific and evolutionary interest (e.g., blood pressure in animal models of heart disease, litter size in pigs, flowering time in plants).

Our method uses a double generalized linear model with linear predictors based on probabilities of line origin. We evaluate our method on simulated F₂ and collaborative cross data, and on a real F₂ intercross, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness to the presence of ordinary mean-controlling QTL. We also illustrate the connection between vQTL and QTL involved in epistasis, explaining how these concepts overlap.

Directional asymmetry (DA), in which one side is consistently larger than the other, has been assumed to be at least partially heritable. Both these assumptions were tested with interval mapping techniques designed to detect any quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting FA or DA in 15 bilateral mandible characters in house mice resulting from a cross of the F1 between CAST/Ei (wild strain) and M16i (selected for rapid growth rate) back to M16i. For purposes of the analysis, all mandibles were triply measured and 92 microsatellite markers were scored in a total of 350 mice. No significant QTLs were found for FA, but three QTLs significantly affected DA in several characters, confirming both assumptions. The QTLs for DA were similar in location to those affecting the size of several of the mandible characters, although they accounted for an average of only 1{\%} of the total phenotypic variation in DA.},

Environmental factors are either identifiable (e.g. temperature) and called macro-environmental or unknown and called micro-environmental. The objectives of this study were to develop a statistical method to estimate genetic parameters for macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities simultaneously, to investigate bias and precision of resulting estimates of genetic parameters and to develop and evaluate use of Akaike's information criterion using h-likelihood to select the best fitting model.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: We assumed that genetic variation in macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities is expressed as genetic variance in the slope of a linear reaction norm and environmental variance, respectively. A reaction norm model to estimate genetic variance for macro-environmental sensitivity was combined with a structural model for residual variance to estimate genetic variance for micro-environmental sensitivity using a double hierarchical generalized linear model in ASReml.

Populations of sires with large half-sib offspring groups were simulated to investigate bias and precision of estimated genetic parameters.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: Designs with 100 sires, each with at least 100 offspring, are required to have standard deviations of estimated variances lower than 50{\%} of the true value. When the number of offspring increased, standard deviations of estimates across replicates decreased substantially, especially for genetic variances of macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities. Standard deviations of estimated genetic correlations across replicates were quite large (between 0.1 and 0.4), especially when sires had few offspring. Practically, no bias was observed for estimates of any of the parameters. Using Akaike's information criterion the true genetic model was selected as the best statistical model in at least 90{\%} of 100 replicates when the number of offspring per sire was 100. Application of the model to lactation milk yield in dairy cattle showed that genetic variance for micro- and macro-environmental sensitivities existed.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: The algorithm and model selection criterion presented here can contribute to better understand genetic control of macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities.

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

abstract = {Genetic heterogeneity underlies many phenotypic variations observed in circadian rhythmicity. Continuous distributions in measures of circadian behavior observed among multiple inbred strains of mice suggest that the inherent contributions to variability are polygenic in nature. To identify genetic loci that underlie this complex behavior, we have carried out a genome-wide complex trait analysis in 196 (C57BL/6J X BALB/cJ)F(2) hybrid mice. We have characterized variation in this panel of F(2) mice among five circadian phenotypes: free-running circadian period, phase angle of entrainment, amplitude of the circadian rhythm, circadian activity level, and dissociation of rhythmicity. Our genetic analyses of these phenotypes have led to the identification of 14 loci having significant effects on this behavior, including significant main effect loci that contribute to three of these phenotypic measures: period, phase, and amplitude. We describe an additional locus detection method, genome-wide genetic interaction analysis, developed to identify locus pairs that may interact epistatically to significantly affect phenotype. Using this analysis, we identified two additional pairs of loci that have significant effects on dissociation and activity level; we also detected interaction effects in loci contributing to differences of period, phase, and amplitude. Although single gene mutations can affect circadian rhythms, the analysis of interstrain variants demonstrates that significant genetic complexity underlies this behavior. Importantly, most of the loci that we have detected by these methods map to locations that differ from the nine known clock genes, indicating the presence of additional clock-relevant genes in the mammalian circadian system. These data demonstrate the analytical value of both genome-wide complex trait and epistatic interaction analyses in further understanding complex phenotypes, and point to promising approaches for genetic analysis of such phenotypes in other mammals, including humans.},

Bayesian model selection revealed a temporally regulated network of multiple QTL for body weight, involving both strong main effects and epistatic effects. No QTL had strong support for both early and late growth, although overlapping combinations of main and epistatic effects were observed at adjacent ages. Most main effects and epistatic interactions had an opposite effect on early and late growth. The contribution of epistasis was more pronounced for body weights at older ages. Body composition traits were also influenced by an interacting network of multiple QTLs. Several main and epistatic effects were shared by the body composition and body weight traits, suggesting that pleiotropy plays an important role in growth and obesity.},

The statistical power to detect genetic control of environmental or phenotypic variability for a quantitative trait was investigated analytically using a monozygotic (MZ) twin difference design and a design using unrelated individuals. The model assumed multiplicative or additive effects of alleles on trait variance at a bi-allelic locus and an additive (regression) model for statistical analysis. If genetic control acts on phenotypic variance then the design using unrelated individuals is more efficient but 10,000s of observations are needed to detect loci explaining at most 3.5{\%} of the variance of the variance at genome-wide significance. If genetic control acts purely on environmental variation then an MZ twin difference design is more efficient when the MZ trait correlation is larger than approximately 0.3. For a locus that explains a given proportion of the variation in variance, twice the number of observations is needed for detection when compared to a locus that explains the same proportion of variation in phenotypes.},

One obstacle to their application is the structured populations often found in crop plants, which may lead to nonfunctional, spurious associations. In this study, statistical methods to account for population structure were extended for use with quantitative variation and applied to our evaluation of maize flowering time. Mutagenesis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies suggested that the maize gene Dwarf8 might affect the quantitative variation of maize flowering time and plant height. The wheat orthologs of this gene contributed to the increased yields seen in the 'Green Revolution' varieties. We used association approaches to evaluate Dwarf8 sequence polymorphisms from 92 maize inbred lines. Population structure was estimated using a Bayesian analysis of 141 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Our results indicate that a suite of polymorphisms associate with differences in flowering time, which include a deletion that may alter a key domain in the coding region. The distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms suggests that Dwarf8 has been a target of selection.},

Our method uses a double generalized linear model with linear predictors based on probabilities of line origin. We evaluate our method on simulated F₂ and collaborative cross data, and on a real F₂ intercross, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness to the presence of ordinary mean-controlling QTL. We also illustrate the connection between vQTL and QTL involved in epistasis, explaining how these concepts overlap.

abstract = {This chapter focuses on assessing canalization and cryptic genetic variation. Regardless of the concerns with the mechanistic explanation of genetic assimilation, the plausibility of the phenomena of genetic assimilation as well as the existence of cryptic genetic variation were established via some empirical experiments. Waddington demonstrated that traits that were invariant under most (normal) environmental circumstances could be sensitized so as to express phenotypic variation for these traits. The classic example of Waddington's was the use of a high-temperature "heat-shock" in Drosophila, which resulted in some flies having lost their wing cross-veins. Waddington demonstrated that the cross-veinless phenotype could be selected upon, suggesting considerable hidden (cryptic) genetic variation for this trait. In considering the origin of developmental variation, one must consider the contribution of both genetic (mutational) sources and sources of variation arising from developmental processes themselves (intrinsic sources of developmental variation). Phenotypic effects of intrinsic developmental variation are seen in phenomena ranging from fluctuating asymmetry to variable penetrance and expressivity of alleles. From evolutionary perspectives, it is possible to conceive that variation arose first as intrinsic variation and then was captured genetically by abundant genetic variation. Such a scenario provides an alternative to the "genes first" ideas of neo-Darwinism and provides additional avenues for rapid and saltational changes in the evolution of development as well as for gradual change. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Large exploratory studies, including candidate-gene-association testing, genomewide linkage-disequilibrium scans, and array-expression experiments, are becoming increasingly common. A serious problem for such studies is that statistical power is compromised by the need to control the false-positive rate for a large family of tests. Because multiple true associations are anticipated, methods have been proposed that combine evidence from the most significant tests, as a more powerful alternative to individually adjusted tests. The practical application of these methods is currently limited by a reliance on permutation testing to account for the correlated nature of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-association data. On a genomewide scale, this is both very time-consuming and impractical for repeated explorations with standard marker panels. Here, we alleviate these problems by fitting analytic distributions to the empirical distribution of combined evidence. We fit extreme-value distributions for fixed lengths of combined evidence and a beta distribution for the most significant length. An initial phase of permutation sampling is required to fit these distributions, but it can be completed more quickly than a simple permutation test and need be done only once for each panel of tests, after which the fitted parameters give a reusable calibration of the panel. Our approach is also a more efficient alternative to a standard permutation test. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach and compare its efficiency with that of permutation tests on genomewide SNP data released by the International HapMap Consortium. The estimation of analytic distributions for combined evidence will allow these powerful methods to be applied more widely in large exploratory studies.},

of genetic markers to analyze quantitative traits has provided
opportunities to discover their genetic architecture in livestock by
identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL). The recent availability of
high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels has advanced
such studies by capitalizing on population-wide linkage disequilibrium
at positions across the genome. In this study, genomic prediction model
Bayes-B was used to identify genomic regions associated with the mean
and standard deviation of egg weight at three ages in a commercial brown
egg layer line. A total of 24 425 segregating SNPs were evaluated
simultaneously using over 2900 genotyped individuals or families. The
corresponding phenotypic records were represented as individual
measurements or family means from full-sib progeny. A novel approach
using the posterior distribution of window variances from the Monte
Carlo Markov Chain samples was used to describe genetic architecture and

QTL region on chromosome 4 was found to explain a large proportion of
the genetic variance for the mean (30{\%}) and standard deviation (up to
16{\%}) of the weight of eggs laid at specific ages. Additional regions
with smaller effects on chromosomes 2, 5, 6, 8, 20, 23, 28 and Z showed
suggestive associations with mean egg weight and a region on chromosome
13 with the standard deviation of egg weight at 2628 weeks of age. The
genetic architecture of the analyzed traits was characterized by a
limited number of genes or genomic regions with large effects and many
regions with small polygenic effects. The region on chromosome 4 can be
used to improve both the mean and standard deviation of egg weight by
marker-assisted selection.},

We then show that the proposed gS test is independent of the generalized location test, under the joint null hypothesis of no mean and no variance heterogeneity. Consequently, we generalize the recently proposed joint location-scale (gJLS) test, valuable in settings where there is an interaction effect but one interacting variable is not available. We evaluate the proposed method via an extensive simulation study and two genetic association application studies.},

abstract = {Numbers of Drosophila sensory bristles present an ideal model system to elucidate the genetic basis of variation for quantitative traits. Here, we review recent evidence that the genetic architecture of variation for bristle numbers is surprisingly complex. A substantial fraction of the Drosophila genome affects bristle number, indicating pervasive pleiotropy of genes that affect quantitative traits. Further, a large number of loci, often with sex- and environment-specific effects that are also conditional on background genotype, affect natural variation in bristle number. Despite this complexity, an understanding of the molecular basis of natural variation in bristle number is emerging from linkage disequilibrium mapping studies of individual candidate genes that affect the development of sensory bristles. We show that there is naturally segregating genetic variance for environmental plasticity of abdominal and sternopleural bristle number. For abdominal bristle number this variance can be attributed in part to an abnormal abdomen-like phenotype that resembles the phenotype of mutants defective in catecholamine biosynthesis. Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) encodes the enzyme that catalyses the final step in the synthesis of dopamine, a major Drosophila catecholamine and neurotransmitter. We found that molecular polymorphisms at Ddc are indeed associated with variation in environmental plasticity of abdominal bristle number.},

abstract = {Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) is a typical problem of regression with uncertain independent variables because the genotype of a putative QTL is not observed. Rather, the genotype is inferred from marker information. The method of maximum likelihood (ML) methods is considered to be the optimal solution for this problem because the distribution of the unobserved QTL genotype is fully taken into account. The simple linear regression method (REG) is a first-order approximation to ML and usually performs very well. In this study, an iteratively reweighted least squares method (IRWLS) is proposed. The new method is a second-order approximation to ML because both the expectation and the variance of the unobserved QTL genotype are taken into consideration. The IRWLS is developed in the context of a single large outbred family. The properties of IRWLS are demonstrated and compared with REG and ML via replicated Monte Carlo simulations. The conclusions are: (1) when marker information content is high, the three methods perform equally well, but ML and IRWLS outperform REG when marker information content is low and the variance explained by the QTL is high; (2) when the residual distribution is not normal, ML can fail or have low power to detect small QTLs, but REG and IRWLS are robust to non-normality; and (3) when the residual distribution is normal, the performance of IRWLS is almost identical to ML, but the computational speed of IRWLS is many times faster than that of ML.},

abstract = {The possibility of breeding for uniform individuals by selecting animals expressing a small response to environment has been studied extensively in animal breeding. Bayesian methods for fitting models with genetic components in the residual variance have been developed for this purpose, but have limitations due to the computational demands. We use the hierarchical (h)-likelihood from the theory of double hierarchical generalized linear models (DHGLM) to derive an estimation algorithm that is computationally feasible for large datasets. Random effects for both the mean and residual variance parts of the model are estimated together with their variance/covariance components. An important feature of the algorithm is that it can fit a correlation between the random effects for mean and variance. An h-likelihood estimator is implemented in the R software and an iterative reweighted least square (IRWLS) approximation of the h-likelihood is implemented using ASReml. The difference in variance component estimates between the two implementations is investigated, as well as the potential bias of the methods, using simulations. IRWLS gives the same results as h-likelihood in simple cases with no severe indication of bias. For more complex cases, only IRWLS could be used, and bias did appear. The IRWLS is applied on the pig litter size data previously analysed by Sorensen {\&} Waagepetersen (2003) using Bayesian methodology. The estimates we obtained by using IRWLS are similar to theirs, with the estimated correlation between the random genetic effects being -0{\textperiodcentered}52 for IRWLS and -0{\textperiodcentered}62 in Sorensen {\&} Waagepetersen (2003).},

Recently, inverse normal transformations (INTs) have gained popularity among genetics researchers and are implemented as an option in several software packages. Despite this increasing use, we are unaware of extensive simulations or mathematical proofs showing that INTs have desirable statistical properties in the context of genetic studies. We show that INTs do not necessarily maintain proper Type 1 error control and can also reduce statistical power in some circumstances. Many alternatives to INTs exist. Therefore, we contend that there is a lack of justification for performing parametric statistical procedures on INTs with the exceptions of simple designs with moderate to large sample sizes, which makes permutation testing computationally infeasible and where maximum likelihood testing is used. Rigorous research evaluating the utility of INTs seems warranted.},

exploring the causes and correlates of consistent individual
differences in mean behavioural traits ('personality') and the
response to the environment ('plasticity'). Recently, it has
been observed that individuals also consistently differ in their
residual intraindividual variability (rIIV). This variation will
probably have broad biological and methodological implications
to the study of trait variation in labile traits, such as
behaviour and physiology, though we currently need studies to
quantify variation in rIIV, using more standardized and powerful
methodology. Focusing on activity rates in guppies (Poecilia
reticulata), we provide a model example, from sampling design to
data analysis, in how to quantify rIIV in labile traits.
Building on the doubly hierarchical generalized linear model
recently used to quantify individual differences in rIIV, we
extend the model to evaluate the covariance between individual
mean values and their rIIV. After accounting for time-related
change in behaviour, our guppies substantially differed in rIIV,
and it was the active individuals that tended to be more
consistent (lower rIIV). We provide annotated data analysis code
to implement these complex models, and discuss how to further
generalize the model to evaluate covariances with other aspects
of phenotypic variation.},

Differences in recombination rate can alter the landscape of the genome and the genetic diversity of populations. Yet our understanding of the genetic basis of recombination rate evolution in nature remains limited. We used wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) from Gough Island (GI), which diverged recently from their mainland counterparts, to characterize the genetics of recombination rate evolution. We quantified genome-wide autosomal recombination rates by immuno-fluorescence cytology in spermatocytes from 240 F 2 males generated from intercrosses between GI-derived mice and the wild-derived inbred strain WSB/EiJ. We identified four quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for inter-F 2 variation in this trait, the strongest of which had effects that opposed the direction of the parental trait differences. Candidate genes and mutations for these QTL were identified by overlapping the detected intervals with whole-genome sequencing data and publicly available transcriptomic profiles from sper-matocytes. Combined with existing studies, our findings suggest that genome-wide recombination rate divergence is not directional and its evolution within and between subspecies proceeds from distinct genetic loci.},

abstract = {In standard models of quantitative traits, genotypes are assumed to differ in mean but not variance of the trait. Here we consider directional selection for a quantitative trait for which genotypes also confer differences in variability, viewed either as differences in residual phenotypic variance when individual loci are concerned or as differences in environmental variability when the whole genome is considered. At an individual locus with additive effects, the selective value of the increasing allele is given by ia/sigma + 1/2 ixb/sigma2, where i is the selection intensity, x is the standardized truncation point, sigma2 is the phenotypic variance, and a/sigma and b/sigma2 are the standardized differences in mean and variance respectively between genotypes at the locus. Assuming additive effects on mean and variance across loci, the response to selection on phenotype in mean is isigma2(Am)/sigma + 1/2 ixcov(Amv)/sigma2 and in variance is icov(Amv)/sigma + 1/2 ixsigma2(Av)/sigma2, where sigma2(Am) is the (usual) additive genetic variance of effects of genes on the mean, sigma2(Av) is the corresponding additive genetic variance of their effects on the variance, and cov(Amv) is the additive genetic covariance of their effects. Changes in variance also have to be corrected for any changes due to gene frequency change and for the Bulmer effect, and relevant formulae are given. It is shown that effects on variance are likely to be greatest when selection is intense and when selection is on individual phenotype or within family deviation rather than on family mean performance. The evidence for and implications of such variability in variance are discussed.},

abstract = {There is recent evidence from laboratory experiments and analysis of livestock populations that not only the phenotype itself, but also its environmental variance, is under genetic control. Little is known about the relationships between the environmental variance of one trait and mean levels of other traits, however. A genetic covariance between these is expected to lead to nonlinearity between them, for example between birth weight and survival of piglets, where animals of extreme weights have lower survival. The objectives were to derive this nonlinear relationship analytically using multiple regression and apply it to data on piglet birth weight and survival. This study provides a framework to study such nonlinear relationships caused by genetic covariance of environmental variance of one trait and the mean of the other. It is shown that positions of phenotypic and genetic optima may differ and that genetic relationships are likely to be more curvilinear than phenotypic relationships, dependent mainly on the environmental correlation between these traits. Genetic correlations may change if the population means change relative to the optimal phenotypes. Data of piglet birth weight and survival show that the presence of nonlinearity can be partly explained by the genetic covariance between environmental variance of birth weight and survival. The framework developed can be used to assess effects of artificial and natural selection on means and variances of traits and the statistical method presented can be used to estimate trade-offs between environmental variance of one trait and mean levels of others.},

abstract = {Most biological traits are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Individual loci contributing to the phenotypic diversity in a population are generally identified by their contributions to the trait mean. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses can also detect loci based on variance differences between genotypes and several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the possible genetic mechanisms leading to such signals. Little is, however, known about what causes them and whether this genetic variance-heterogeneity reflects mechanisms of importance in natural populations. Previously, we identified a variance-heterogeneity GWA (vGWA) signal for leaf molybdenum concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, fine-mapping of this association to a {\~{}}78 kb Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)-block reveals that it emerges from the independent effects of three genetic polymorphisms on the high-variance associated version of this LD-block. By revealing the genetic architecture underlying this vGWA signal, we uncovered the molecular source of a significant amount of hidden additive genetic variation (“missing heritability”). Two of the three polymorphisms on the high-variance LD-block are promoter variants for Molybdate transporter 1 (MOT1), and the third a variant located {\~{}}25 kb downstream of this gene. A fourth independent association was also detected {\~{}}600 kb upstream of the LD-block. Testing of T-DNA knockout alleles for genes in the associated regions suggest AT2G25660 (unknown function) and AT2G26975 (Copper Transporter 6; COPT6) as the strongest candidates for the associations outside MOT1. Our results show that multi-allelic genetic architectures within a single LD-block can lead to a variance-heterogeneity between genotypes in natural populations. Further they provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of ion homeostasis in A. thaliana, and empirically confirm that variance-heterogeneity based GWA methods are a valuable tool to detect novel associations of biological importance in natural populations.},

Here we quantified genome-wide variation in gene expression in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), increasing the annotated Drosophila transcriptome by 11{\%}, including thousands of novel transcribed regions (NTRs). We found that 42{\%} of the Drosophila transcriptome is genetically variable in males and females, including the NTRs, and is organized into modules of genetically correlated transcripts. We found that NTRs often were negatively correlated with the expression of protein-coding genes, which we exploited to annotate NTRs functionally. We identified regulatory variants for the mean and variance of gene expression, which have largely independent genetic control. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the mean, but not for the variance, of gene expression were concentrated near genes. Notably, the variance eQTLs often interacted epistatically with local variants in these genes to regulate gene expression. This comprehensive characterization of population-scale diversity of transcriptomes and its genetic basis in the DGRP is critically important for a systems understanding of quantitative trait variation.},

abstract = {Testing for genetic effects on mean values of a quantitative trait has been a very successful strategy. However, most studies to date have not explored genetic effects on the variance of quantitative traits as a relevant consequence of genetic variation. In this report, we demonstrate that, under plausible scenarios of genetic interaction, the variance of a quantitative trait is expected to differ among the three possible genotypes of a biallelic SNP. Leveraging this observation with Levene's test of equality of variance, we propose a novel method to prioritize SNPs for subsequent gene-gene and gene-environment testing. This method has the advantageous characteristic that the interacting covariate need not be known or measured for a SNP to be prioritized. Using simulations, we show that this method has increased power over exhaustive search under certain conditions. We further investigate the utility of variance per genotype by examining data from the Women's Genome Health Study. Using this dataset, we identify new interactions between the LEPR SNP rs12753193 and body mass index in the prediction of C-reactive protein levels, between the ICAM1 SNP rs1799969 and smoking in the prediction of soluble ICAM-1 levels, and between the PNPLA3 SNP rs738409 and body mass index in the prediction of soluble ICAM-1 levels. These results demonstrate the utility of our approach and provide novel genetic insight into the relationship among obesity, smoking, and inflammation.},

abstract = {The circadian system is entrained to the environmental light/dark cycle via retinal photoreceptors and regulates numerous aspects of physiology and behavior, including sleep. These processes are all key factors in healthy aging showing a gradual decline with age. Despite their importance, the exact mechanisms underlying this decline are yet to be fully understood. One of the most effective tools we have to understand the genetic factors underlying these processes are genetically inbred mouse strains. The most commonly used reference mouse strain is C57BL/6J, but recently, resources such as the International Knockout Mouse Consortium have started producing large numbers of mouse mutant lines on a pure genetic background, C57BL/6N. Considering the substantial genetic diversity between mouse strains we expect there to be phenotypic differences, including differential effects of aging, in these and other strains. Such differences need to be characterized not only to establish how different mouse strains may model the aging process but also to understand how genetic background might modify age-related phenotypes. To ascertain the effects of aging on sleep/wake behavior, circadian rhythms, and light input and whether these effects are mouse strain-dependent, we have screened C57BL/6J, C57BL/6N, C3H-HeH, and C3H-Pde6b+ mouse strains at 5 ages throughout their life span. Our data show that sleep, circadian, and light input parameters are all disrupted by the aging process. Moreover, we have cataloged a number of strain-specific aging effects, including the rate of cataract development, decline in the pupillary light response, and changes in sleep fragmentation and the proportion of time spent asleep.},

abstract = {The persistence of behaviorally deleterious genes in the human population poses an interesting question for population genetics: If certain alleles at these loci are deleterious, why have they survived in the population? We consider evidence for phenotypic capacitance and/or frequency-dependent selection for an allele that has been putatively shown to have negative associations with human behaviors (the "short" 5-HTT promoter region allele) yet has persisted in human and nonhuman primate populations. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we compare sibling and twin variation in depression by 5-HTT genotype (specified in several ways) and investigate sibship-level cross-person gene-gene interactions. In support of the "orchid/dandelion" hypothesis, we find evidence that the short allele increases variation in phenotypes in response to environmental (or genetic) differences (i.e., acts as a perturbation of a phenotypic capacitor). Further, we also find some evidence that the effects of allelic variation at this locus are moderated by the genetic environment of the sibship unit (i.e., effects may be susceptible to frequency-dependent selection). We discuss implications of these findings for genetic models in general, specifically with respect to stable unit treatment value assumption violations (i.e., nonindependence of units of analysis).},

Empirical confidence intervals were calculated using a bootstrap resampling method for a backcross population derived from inbred lines. Sample sizes were either 200 or 500 individuals, and the QTL explained 1, 5, or 10{\%} of the phenotypic variance. The method worked well in that the proportion of empirical confidence intervals that contained the simulated QTL was close to expectation. In general, the confidence intervals were slightly conservatively biased. Correlations between the test statistic and the width of the confidence interval were strongly negative, so that the stronger the evidence for a QTL segregating, the smaller the empirical confidence interval for its location. The size of the average confidence interval depended heavily on the population size and the effect of the QTL. Marker spacing had only a small effect on the average empirical confidence interval. The LOD drop-off method to calculate empirical support intervals gave confidence intervals that generally were too small, in particular if confidence intervals were calculated only for samples above a certain significance threshold. The bootstrap method is easy to implement and is useful in the analysis of experimental data.},

Methods to analyse these data, based on maximum-likelihood, have been developed and provide good estimates of QTL effects in some situations. Maximum-likelihood methods are, however, relatively complex and can be computationally slow. In this paper we develop methods for mapping QTL based on multiple regression which can be applied using any general statistical package. We use the example of mapping in an F(2) population and show that these regression methods produce very similar results to those obtained using maximum likelihood. The relative simplicity of the regression methods means that models with more than a single QTL can be explored and we give examples of two lined loci and of two interacting loci. Other models, for example with more than two QTL, with environmental fixed effects, with between family variance or for threshold traits, could be fitted in a similar way. The ease, speed of application and generality of regression methods for flanking marker analysis, and the good estimates they obtain, suggest that they should provide the method of choice for the analysis of QTL mapping data from inbred line crosses.},

We report a genotypic variability-based genome-wide association study (vGWAS) of six cohorts of sero-negative RA recruited in Europe and the US that were genotyped with the Immunochip. A two-stage approach was used: (1) a mixed model to partition dichotomous phenotypes into an additive component and non-additive residuals on the liability scale and (2) the Levene's test to assess equality of the residual variances across genotype groups. The vGWAS identified rs2852853 (P = 1.3e-08, DHCR7) and rs62389423 (P = 1.8e-05, near IRF4) in addition to two previously identified loci (HLA-DQB1 and ANKRD55), which were all statistically validated using cross validation. DHCR7 encodes an enzyme important in cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D and DHCR7 mutations are believed to be important for early humans to adapt to Northern Europe where residents have reduced ultraviolet-B exposure and tend to have light skin color. IRF4 is a key locus responsible for skin color, with a vitamin D receptor-binding interval. These vGWAS results together suggest that vitamin D deficiency is potentially causal of sero-negative RA and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder.},

The following review describes several animal models of bipolar mania with a focus on more recent findings using genetically modified mice, including several with the potential of investigating the mechanisms underlying 'mood' cycling (or behavioral switching in rodents). We discuss whether each of these models satisfy criteria of validity (i.e., face, predictive, and construct), while highlighting their strengths and limitations. Animal models are helping to address critical questions related to pathophysiology of bipolar mania, in an effort to more clearly define necessary targets of first-line medications, lithium and valproic acid, and to discover novel mechanisms with the hope of developing more effective therapeutics. Future studies will leverage new technologies and strategies for integrating animal and human data to reveal important insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of BD.},

Although permutation testing is a popular approach for determining statistical significance of a test statistic with an unknown distribution--for instance, the maximum of multiple correlated statistics or some omnibus test statistic for a gene, gene-set, or pathway--naive application of permutations may result in an invalid test. The risk of performing an invalid permutation test is particularly acute in complex trait mapping where polygenicity may combine with a structured population resulting from the presence of families, cryptic relatedness, admixture, or population stratification. I give both analytical derivations and a conceptual understanding of why typical permutation procedures fail and suggest an alternative permutation-based algorithm, MVNpermute, that succeeds. In particular, I examine the case where a linear mixed model is used to analyze a quantitative trait and show that both phenotype and genotype permutations may result in an invalid permutation test. I provide a formula that predicts the amount of inflation of the type 1 error rate depending on the degree of misspecification of the covariance structure of the polygenic effect and the heritability of the trait. I validate this formula by doing simulations, showing that the permutation distribution matches the theoretical expectation, and that my suggested permutation-based test obtains the correct null distribution. Finally, I discuss situations where naive permutations of the phenotype or genotype are valid and the applicability of the results to other test statistics.},

After observing unexpected variability in type I error rates from SNP-by-genome interaction scans, we sought to characterize this variability and test the ability of heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors to correct it. We performed 81 SNP-by-genome interaction scans using a product-term model on quantitative traits in a sample of 1,053 unrelated European Americans from the NHLBI Family Heart Study, and additional scans on five simulated datasets. We found that the interaction-term genomic inflation factor (lambda) showed inflation and deflation that varied with sample size and allele frequency; that similar lambda variation occurred in the absence of population substructure; and that lambda was strongly related to heteroskedasticity but not to minor non-normality of phenotypes. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors narrowed the range of lambda, with HC3 outperforming HC0, but in individual scans tended to create new P-value outliers related to sparse two-locus genotype classes. We explain the lambda variation as a result of non-independence of test statistics coupled with stochastic biases in test statistics due to a failure of the test to reach asymptotic properties. We propose that one way to interpret lambda is by comparison to an empirical distribution generated from data simulated under the null hypothesis and without population substructure. We further conclude that the interaction-term lambda should not be used to adjust test statistics and that heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors come with limitations that may outweigh their benefits in this setting.},

abstract = {The contribution that pleiotropic effects of individual loci make to covariation among traits is well understood theoretically and is becoming well documented empirically. However, little is known about the role of epistasis in determining patterns of covariation among traits. To address this problem we combine a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with a two-locus model to assess the contribution of epistasis to the genetic architecture of variation and covariation of organ weights and limb bone lengths in a backcross population of mice created from the M16i and CAST/Ei strains. Significant epistasis was exhibited by 14 pairwise combinations of QTL for organ weights and 10 combinations of QTL for limb bone lengths, which contributed, on average, about 5{\%} of the variation in organ weights and 8{\%} in limb bone lengths beyond that of single-locus QTL effects. Epistatic pleiotropy was much more common in the limb bones (seven of 10 epistatic combinations affecting limb bone lengths were pleiotropic) than the organs (three of the 14 epistatic combinations affecting organ weights were pleiotropic). In both cases, epistatic pleiotropy was less common than single-locus pleiotropy. Epistatic pleiotropy accounted for an average of 6{\%} of covariation among organ weights and 21{\%} of covariation among limb bone lengths, which represented an average of one-fifth (for organ weights) and one-third (for limb bone lengths) of the total genetic covariance between traits. Thus, although epistatic pleiotropy made a smaller contribution than single-locus pleiotropy, it clearly made a significant contribution to the genetic architecture of variation/covariation.},

abstract = {We investigated the genetic basis of several limb bone lengths and weights of organs in mice produced from a cross of the F1 between CAST/Ei (wild strain) and M16i (selected for rapid growth rate) back to M16i. From previous correlation studies, we hypothesized that quantitative trait loci (QTLs) would exhibit greater pleiotropy within than between the limb length and organ weight character sets. Using interval mapping procedures and significance testing at the chromosome-wise level, we discovered 14 putative QTLs affecting weight of the liver, spleen, heart, and/or kidney, 9 of which affected more than one organ; and 12 QTLs for limb lengths, all of which affected the length of two or more of the limb bones in these mice. As was hypothesized, most QTLs affected either organ weights or limb lengths independently of each other, although five QTLs were found that affected both sets of characters. The direction of the effect of these QTLs was almost always consistent within and between characters, with little evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy.},

abstract = {Identifying the genes underlying adaptation is a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we describe the molecular changes underlying adaptive coat color variation in a natural population of rock pocket mice, Chaetodipus intermedius. Rock pocket mice are generally light-colored and live on light-colored rocks. However, populations of dark (melanic) mice are found on dark lava, and this concealing coloration provides protection from avian and mammalian predators. We conducted association studies by using markers in candidate pigmentation genes and discovered four mutations in the melanocortin-1-receptor gene, Mc1r, that seem to be responsible for adaptive melanism in one population of lava-dwelling pocket mice. Interestingly, another melanic population of these mice on a different lava flow shows no association with Mc1r mutations, indicating that adaptive dark color has evolved independently in this species through changes at different genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statistical analysis of genome-wide microarrays can result in many thousands of identical statistical tests being performed as each probe is tested for an association with a phenotype of interest. If there were no association between any of the probes and the phenotype, the distribution of P values obtained from statistical tests would resemble a Uniform distribution. If a selection of probes were significantly associated with the phenotype we would expect to observe P values for these probes of less than the designated significance level, alpha, resulting in more P values of less than alpha than expected by chance. RESULTS: In data from a whole genome methylation promoter array we unexpectedly observed P value distributions where there were fewer P values less than alpha than would be expected by chance. Our data suggest that a possible reason for this is a violation of the statistical assumptions required for these tests arising from heteroskedasticity. A simple but statistically sound remedy (a heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimator to calculate standard errors of regression coefficients that are robust to heteroskedasticity) rectified this violation and resulted in meaningful P value distributions. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical analysis of 'omics data requires careful handling, especially in the choice of statistical test. To obtain meaningful results it is essential that the assumptions behind these tests are carefully examined and any violations rectified where possible, or a more appropriate statistical test chosen.},

This variability is linked to stochasticity in gene expression, which is generally viewed as having detrimental effects on cellular function with potential implications for disease. However, stochasticity in gene expression can also be advantageous. It can provide the flexibility needed by cells to adapt to fluctuating environments or respond to sudden stresses, and a mechanism by which population heterogeneity can be established during cellular differentiation and development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The X chromosome plays an important role in human diseases and traits. However, few X-linked associations have been reported in genome-wide association studies, partly due to analytical complications and low statistical power.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we propose tests of X-linked association that capitalize on variance heterogeneity caused by various factors, predominantly the process of X-inactivation. In the presence of X-inactivation, the expression of one copy of the chromosome is randomly silenced. Due to the consequent elevated randomness of expressed variants, females that are heterozygotes for a quantitative trait locus might exhibit higher phenotypic variance for that trait. We propose three tests that build on this phenomenon: 1) A test for inflated variance in heterozygous females; 2) A weighted association test; and 3) A combined test. Test 1 captures the novel signal proposed herein by directly testing for higher phenotypic variance of heterozygous than homozygous females. As a test of variance it is generally less powerful than standard tests of association that consider means, which is supported by extensive simulations. Test 2 is similar to a standard association test in considering the phenotypic mean, but differs by accounting for (rather than testing) the variance heterogeneity. As expected in light of X-inactivation, this test is slightly more powerful than a standard association test. Finally, test 3 further improves power by combining the results of the first two tests. We applied the these tests to the ARIC cohort data and identified a novel X-linked association near gene AFF2 with blood pressure, which was not significant based on standard association testing of mean blood pressure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Variance-based tests examine overdispersion, thereby providing a complementary type of signal to a standard association test. Our results point to the potential to improve power of detecting X-linked associations in the presence of variance heterogeneity.},

@article{Waddington1942,
abstract = {THE battle, which raged for so long between the theories of evolution supported by geneticists on one hand and by naturalists on the other, has in recent years gone strongly in favour of the former. Few biologists now doubt that genetical investigation has revealed at any rate the most important categories of hereditary variation ; and the classical ‘naturalist' theory-the inheritance of acquired characters-has been very generally relegated to the background because, in the forms in which it has been put forward, it has required a type of hereditary variation for the existence of which there was no adequate evidence. The long popularity of the theory was based, not on any positive evidence for it, but on its usefulness in accounting for some of the most striking of the results of evolution. Naturalists cannot fail to be continually and deeply impressed by the adaptation of an organism to its surroundings and of the parts of the organism to each other. These adaptive characters are inherited and some explanation of this must be provided. If we are deprived of the hypothesis of the inheritance of the effects of use and disuse, we seem thrown back on an exclusive reliance on the natural selection of merely chance mutations. It is doubtful, however, whether even the most statistically minded geneticists are entirely satisfied that nothing more is involved than the sorting out of random mutations by the natural selective filter. It is the purpose of this short communication to suggest that recent views on the nature of the developmental process make it easier to understand how the genotypes of evolving organisms can respond to the environment in a more co-ordinated fashion.},
